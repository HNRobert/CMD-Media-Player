It's NOT perfect currently, of course, because now it's actually silence while playing.

And I'm afraid it only support macOS on Apple Silicon (Not sure about intel based macOS), while Windows version will be rolled out a little bit later.

I'll continuously work on this later, and will try to bring out a better result for you guys!
